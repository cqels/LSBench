# LSBench (Linked Stream Benchmark)

Our Linked Stream Benchmark (LSBench)[1] published in an ISWC paper 2012 [2] has been used in several very recent ICDE[3], SIGMOD[4] and EDBT[5] papers related to streaming graphs, so, we have decided to put some resources in developing and maintaining the source code. This is the placeholder for the next release. If you need a direct support for LSBench, don't hesitate to contact me or create an issue in this repository.

# The upcoming tasks we are developing:

- [ ] Synchronize with Data Generator of LDBC Social Network Benchmark 
- [ ] Dockerise
- [ ] Support other Formats
- [ ] Support Stream Reasoning Features ( e.g. integrate with LUBM/UOBM ontology generator)
- [ ] Create Adapter to SUMO (traffic simulation engine) to simulate GPS coordinates with Open Street Maps 
- [ ] Build The Test Drivers for Websocket and MQTT
