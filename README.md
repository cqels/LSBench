# LSBench
Linked Stream Benchmark

Our Linked Stream Benchmark (LSBench)[1] published in an ISWC paper 2012 [2] has been used in several very recent ICDE[3], SIGMOD[4] and EDBT[5] papers related to streaming graphs, so, we have decided to put some resources in developing and maintaining the source code. If you need a direct support for LSBench, don't hesitate to contact me or create an issue in this directory.

# The upcoming tasks we are developing:

- [ ] Synchronize with Data Generator of LDBC Social Network Benchmark 
- [ ] Dockerise
- [ ] Support other Formats
- [ ] Support Reasoning Features ()
- [ ] Create Adapter to SUMO (traffic simulation engine) to simulate GPS coordinates with Open Street Maps 
- [ ] Build The Test Drive for Websocket and MQTT
