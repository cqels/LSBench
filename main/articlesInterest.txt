Bette Midler  The Best of Bette 1981 album  The Best of Bette is a compilation album by American singer Bette Midler released on the K-tel label in Australia and New Zealand in 1981 The album was the second compilation to use the title The Best of Bette the previous version with different cover art and an entirely different track list having been released on the Atlantic Records label in both the UK Continental Europe Scandinavia Australia and New Zealand in 1978 The K-tel compilation is highly notable in Midlers discography for a number of reasons the first of them being that it was released by the US based K-tel label instead of Midlers original label Atlantic Records today a subsidiary of Warner Music Group K-Tel was a budget-price label specialising in releasing as-seen-on-TV compilations including the latest chart hits but at this stage rarely released a whole albums worth of recordings by the one and same artist Atlantic Records had exclusive rights to Midlers catalogue worldwide the sixteen tracks were consequently licensed from Atlantic - but obviously only for release in Australia and New Zealand not in the US or Europe The second reason making the album both notable and collectable is the track selection; the album includes songs that by 1981 already had become standards in Midlers repertoire such as her signature tune Friends Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy Delta Dawn and Do You Want To Dance and combines these with ten tracks taken from her then three most recent albums; a the disco-flavoured Thighs and Whispers 1979 and the two hit singles Married Men and My Knight In Black Leather b the soundtrack The Rose 1980 and live recordings like When A Man Loves A Woman Midnight In Memphis and Love With A Feeling the latter two never issued as singles as well as the studio-recorded title track The Rose the single version with orchestral overdubs in effect making its debut on this album and finally c the soundtrack to the concert documentary Divine Madness 1980 and the tracks My Mothers Eyes the only single release from the album and Fire Down Below also featured in the movie The Rose but first released on the Divine Madness album The K-Tel compilation couples these with a few selections from the albums Broken Blossom and Live at Last such as Say Goodbye To Hollywood and Youre Moving Out Today the latter a rare single mix with an additional verse making its second appearance on a compilation album The pictures used for the cover of the K-Tel version of The Best of Bette show Midler in concert taken from the movie The Rose The compilation is sometimes listed as having been released in 1980 other times in 1981 Considering the fact that the Divine Madness album was released worldwide in November 1980 it was more likely issued in 1981 The first Bette Midler greatest hits compilation to be released worldwide including the US and Canada was 1993s Experience the Divine

Billy Joel  The Ballad of Billy the Kid  The Ballad of Billy the Kid is a Billy Joel song from the album Piano Man It is a historically inaccurate story of Billy The Kid In the song Billy the Kid who grew up in Wheeling West Virginia was famous throughout the West during his lifetime as a bank robber However he never robbed a bank and he was little known in his own lifetime but was catapulted into legend in the year after his death when his killer Sheriff Pat Garrett published a wildly sensationalistic biography of the outlaw called The Authentic Life of Billy the Kid Beginning with Garretts account Billy the Kid grew into a symbolic figure of the American Old West The song also says that Billy the Kid was captured and hanged with many people attending the hanging In reality however he was shot and killed by Pat Garrett Joel has stated in interviews and concerts that he wrote the song when he was traveling west from New York to California for the first time He was inspired to write a western song One inspiration for the song was the American composer Aaron Copland also admitted by Joel in interviews which is apparent in both the classical-style music within the song and the name of the song itself In some live versions Joel plays the songs long opening and says Every verse in this song is a lie and You have to imagine its a Western movie with the credits rolling across the screen Randolph Scott Lee Van Cleef Clint Eastwood  The Billy from Oyster Bay was not Joel but rather a bartender who worked there By the way Billy in this case is not me myself and I He still tends bar in Oyster Bay The song was featured on the January 31 2010 episode of Family Guy entitled Dial Meg for Murder
