The stream data is generated by using the parameter -stream

Now, the data generator supports generating the post stream data. 

We can simply run the script ./runExp in order to generate the post stream data for 10,000 users in one year. 

All the output files will be stored in directory outputDir/, in which
- mr0_sibdataset10000.ttl  is the dataset containing all the users's profile information, friendships,... Which is currently considered as the static data

- rdfPostStream.nt is the streaming data of posts and comments

....



==== Tunning the parameters =====

Those parameters in param.ini can be adjusted in order to generate the smaller amount of data: 

startYear: 2010
startMonth: 1
startDate: 1
endYear: 2010
endMonth: 3
endDate: 1

maxNumLocationPostPerMonth: 30
maxNumInterestPostPerMonth: 50
maxNumComments: 20


maxNumPhotoAlbums: 5
maxNumPhotoPerAlbums: 20


However, note that since we consider the "number of post/photo per month" make the endTime - startTime should be >= 1 month
